          <p id="kids-explained">
            About 5000 people per day flee Venezuela, many crossing the
            Colombian border at CÃºcuta. A total of 5.4 million Venezuelans have
            left the country since 2014. These figures are comparable to the
            Syrian refugee crisis, yet the news all but ignores this. Watch this
            video we produced regarding the crisis for children.
